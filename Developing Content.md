# Developing Content for Vectorworks

The following link brings you to the Vectorworks Resource Style Guide main page, with helpful information about creating content for Vectorworks. The guides available from the link apply to third parties adding content to the application, as well as those providing content to their own customers through manufacturer product pages, BIM hosting sites, or other types of content hosting. They provide insight and comparisons on how Vectorworks develops some of its resources for inclusion within the application, and our recommendations for third party content developers.
We have provided a basic guide for all products, plus entertainment-specific guides for creating lighting devices, speakers, bumpers, and ConnectCAD content.
Over time, more content development guides will be added.
